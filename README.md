[https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10701]

The repository is the code application of research paper during the internship in Summers 2019 under
Dr. Vivek Kanhangad at Indian Institute of Technology Indore.

The paper is authored by Mr. Vijay Anand and Dr. Vivek Kanhangad. Mr. Anand worked the Ph.D. guide during the internship period
and supervised the work created and the outputs generated through this code.

The repository does not have the dataset images. The code is provided in this repository is fully functional and
a sample model (.pth file) is provided for usage.
